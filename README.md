I am going to try to make my first website deacent. I am using the absouloutly honorable node.js and express to make my dreams into reality and i will continue to do this until i give up. But i wont give up because these things are the building blocks of a betteor life and i will not lose out on it because i give up no i will never and i will keep fighting for my passion to get a better life. I hope this message has found you well. I aim to inspire you so do the thing you want stop procrastanaiting and just do it(trademarked by nike). This is the end of this text which i have spent many minutes on typing. Fun fact i type with dvorak instead of qwerty. Goodbye. - ArwinSemlan
